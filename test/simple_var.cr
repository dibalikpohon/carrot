-- An example of variable
name as str = "John"
--println(name)

-- You can get the type of variable using type() function
--t as str = type(name)
--println("type of name: ", t)

-- Uninitialized variable
--age as int
--println(age) -- should print 0

-- Another variable
--pi as float = 3.14

-- Carrot performs type inference if we specfy "any" as the data type
--some_object as any = 123
--println(some_object)

-- However, unitialized variable without initialization will be null-valued
--another_object as any
--println(another_object)
